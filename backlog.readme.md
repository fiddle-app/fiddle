# Backlog Management System

The backlogs in this project (`backlog.md` and `backlog-done.md`) are managed by the **backlog-manager skill**. You can add items manually in any loose format — the skill will clean them up, assign IDs, and sort everything for you.

-----

## Quick Start

### Status and type at a glance

**Priority (`P` column) — shown first because it drives sort order:**

|Value|Meaning                        |
|-----|-------------------------------|
|P1   |Urgent                         |
|P2   |Normal (default if unspecified)|
|P3   |Someday / maybe                |

**Status (`S` column):**

|Value|Meaning                             |
|-----|------------------------------------|
|`.`  |Open / not started                  |
|`~`  |In progress                         |
|`!`  |Blocked                             |
|`x`  |Done (moved to `backlog-done.md`)   |
|`-`  |Dropped (moved to `backlog-done.md`)|

**Item type (first letter of ID):**

|Letter|Type         |Description                                                                     |
|------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|B     |Bug          |Defects, regressions, broken behavior                                           |
|C     |Coding       |New features, enhancements, implementation                                      |
|D     |Design       |UI/UX, visual design, mockups, style decisions                                  |
|H     |Human        |Actions only a human can take (call someone, record something, solicit feedback)|
|P     |Planning     |Architecture decisions, scoping, research, design spikes                        |
|T     |Testing      |QA, validation, device testing, user testing                                    |
|X     |Cross-project|Coordination tasks touching multiple projects or shared resources               |

### Adding items manually

Just append a plain line to the bottom of `backlog.md`. You don’t need to worry about formatting, IDs, or priority. The skill will handle it on the next cleanup.

If you know the type, lead with the letter and a colon:

```
C: add support for ABC file import
B: volume control unresponsive on first tap
H: ask Rhys to review the tuning display
```

Include a priority anywhere in the line if you want to specify one:

```
P1 C: fix the focus-loss silence bug
H: ask Rhys to review the tuning display P3
B: volume control unresponsive P1 on first tap
```

If you omit priority, the skill defaults to P2.

You can add loose lines anywhere in the file — including between existing table rows. The skill will find and process them wherever they appear. If you copy an existing row and paste it nearby to use as a starting point, delete the numeric part of the ID (leave just the category letter) or delete the ID entirely. If a duplicate ID is detected, the first occurrence is kept and the second gets a fresh ID assigned.

To mark an item done, put an `x` anywhere near its current status indicator:

```
.x    x.    ~x    x~    !x
```

-----

### Invoking the skill

- **Clean up** the backlog (reformat loose lines, assign IDs, sort by priority):
  - *“Clean up the backlog”*
- **Add** an item (skill adds, formats, and re-sorts immediately):
  - *“Add a backlog item to have Rhys review the app and give feedback”*
  - *“Add a P1 bug — losing audio after focus loss”*
  - *“Add a someday item to explore a dark mode”*
- **Update** status or priority (re-sorts after every update):
  - *“Mark B1 done”*
  - *“Mark C3 blocked”*
  - *“Drop P2 — not pursuing that approach”*
  - *“Change H1 to P1”*
- **Query** the backlog:
  - *“What’s still open in the coding category?”*
  - *“Show me everything that’s blocked”*
  - *“What P1 items are left?”*
- **Initialize** a new backlog in the current folder:
  - *“Initialize a new backlog here”*
- **Add** a child project to this backlog family:
  - *“Add a new child project called TuneReview”*
- **Disconnect** all child backlogs from this family:
  - *“Disconnect all child backlogs”*
  - ⚠️ The skill will warn you and list every file that will be modified before proceeding.

### Cross-referencing items in other backlogs

Each `backlog.md` has a collapsible **Prefixes** section at the top listing the other projects in this family and their prefix letters. To reference an item in another backlog, use square brackets with the prefixed ID:

```
[EC3]    (Ear Tuner, item C3)
[PP1]    (Parent/family backlog, item P1)
[HC2]    (TuneHub, item C2)
```

The parent backlog always uses the reserved prefix **`P`**. No child project may use `P` as its prefix.

Use cross-references in the Notes field of any item:

```
| X1 | P2 | . | Coordinate settings icon across apps | See [ED1], [MD1] |
```

When cleanup encounters a cross-reference like `[EC3]`, it converts it to a clickable relative hyperlink and adds an invisible HTML anchor tag to the target row’s Notes cell so the link resolves correctly:

```markdown
[EC3](../ear-tuner/backlog.md#EC3)
```

The anchor in the target file looks like this (appended after any existing Notes text):

```
| C3 | P2 | . | Add Copy Log button | Needs C1 <a id="EC3"></a> |
```

Anchor tags are only added when a row is actually referenced — they serve as a useful signal that something elsewhere is pointing to that item. When cleanup adds an anchor to a file in another project folder, it will tell you so you know to commit and push that repo as well.

## Backlog Format

### backlog.md

```markdown
# Ear Tuner — Backlog

<details>
<summary>Prefixes (for referencing items in other backlogs)</summary>

| Prefix | Project |
|--------|---------|
| P | Fiddle App Family (parent) |
| B | MicroBreaker |
| E | Ear Tuner (this project) |
| I | Intonio |
| H | TuneHub |
| M | Media Markup |
| L | TuneList |

</details>

| ID | P  | S | Description | Notes |
|----|-----|---|-------------|-------|
| B1 | P1 | ! | Fix focus-loss audio silence bug | iOS only |
| C1 | P2 | ~ | Implement localStorage logging circular buffer | Group 2 |
| H1 | P2 | . | Decide on max log retention count | Before C1 |
| C2 | P3 | . | Add Copy Log button to Settings | Needs C1 |
```

### backlog-done.md

```markdown
# Ear Tuner — Done & Dropped

| ID | P  | S | Description | Notes |
|----|-----|---|-------------|-------|
| B2 | P2 | x | Fix BFCache iOS issue | |
| P1 | P3 | - | Investigate Web Audio worklet approach | Superseded by simpler fix |
```

Done items are appended in the order they were completed and never re-sorted.

-----

## Sort Order

After cleanup, open items are sorted by priority, then by status within each priority:

```
P1 !  (urgent + blocked)
P1 ~  (urgent + in progress)
P1 .  (urgent + not started)
P2 !
P2 ~
P2 .
P3 !
P3 ~
P3 .
```

-----

## ID Sequences

- Each category letter has its own sequence: `B1 B2 B3`, `C1 C2 C3`, etc.
- Numbers are never reused, even after an item is dropped or completed.
- The current high-water mark for each category is stored in `backlog/backlog-meta.json`. Do not edit that file manually.
- All ID letters are uppercase.

-----

## Prefixes

- The parent backlog always uses the reserved prefix **`P`**.
- Child prefixes are chosen when the child is added and must be unique and must not be `P`.
- The skill will display all in-use prefixes when prompting for a new child prefix.

-----

## backlog-meta.json

This file records the project’s position in the hierarchy and the current ID high-water marks.

### Parent folder

```json
{
  "level": "parent",
  "prefix": "P",
  "name": "Fiddle App Family",
  "children": [
    { "name": "MicroBreaker", "prefix": "B" },
    { "name": "Ear Tuner", "prefix": "E" },
    { "name": "Intonio", "prefix": "I" },
    { "name": "TuneHub", "prefix": "H" },
    { "name": "Media Markup", "prefix": "M" },
    { "name": "TuneList", "prefix": "L" }
  ],
  "ids": { "B": 0, "C": 0, "D": 0, "H": 0, "P": 0, "T": 0, "X": 0 }
}
```

### Child folder

```json
{
  "level": "child",
  "prefix": "E",
  "name": "Ear Tuner",
  "parent": { "name": "Fiddle App Family", "prefix": "P" },
  "siblings": [
    { "name": "MicroBreaker", "prefix": "B" },
    { "name": "Intonio", "prefix": "I" },
    { "name": "TuneHub", "prefix": "H" },
    { "name": "Media Markup", "prefix": "M" },
    { "name": "TuneList", "prefix": "L" }
  ],
  "ids": { "B": 0, "C": 0, "D": 0, "H": 0, "P": 0, "T": 0, "X": 0 }
}
```

A parent with no children registered yet is treated identically to a standalone backlog — just a parent waiting for children to be added.

-----

## Skill Behavior and Guardrails

**Initialization:**

- Creates `backlog.md` and `backlog.readme.md` in the current folder, and `backlog/backlog-done.md` and `backlog/backlog-meta.json` in the `backlog/` subfolder.
- Always initializes as a parent-level backlog. Children are added separately.
- Will not overwrite existing backlog files.

**Adding a child project:**

- Must be run from the parent folder context.
- Skill displays all in-use prefixes and prompts for the new child’s prefix.
- `P` is always shown as reserved for the parent.
- Creates backlog files in the child folder if none exist. If files already exist, updates `backlog/backlog-meta.json` and the prefix table only — never overwrites backlog content.
- Refuses if run from a child folder (two-level limit).
- Refuses if the target child folder already contains a parent-level backlog.

**Disconnecting all children:**

- Removes hierarchy from `backlog/backlog-meta.json` in the parent and all child folders.
- Leaves prefix tables in `backlog.md` files intact but adds a note that the backlog has been disconnected from its family.
- Skill explicitly lists all files that will be modified and requires confirmation before proceeding.
- All affected backlogs become independent parent-level backlogs after disconnect.

## Folder Structure

Each folder in the hierarchy contains:

|File/Folder                |Purpose                           |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
|`backlog.md`               |Active items                      |
|`backlog.readme.md`        |This documentation (parent only)  |
|`backlog/backlog-done.md`  |Completed and dropped items       |
|`backlog/backlog-meta.json`|ID counters and hierarchy metadata|
|`backlog/`                 |Also holds reference `.md` files  |

Child folders do not get their own copy of `backlog.readme.md`.

Child folders may be part of the same source control repo as the parent, or they may be separate repos wired in as git submodules. Either way, cross-references between backlogs rely on relative file paths, so the parent-child folder hierarchy must remain stable on disk. If you use submodules, VS Code will resolve relative links correctly in its markdown preview.
